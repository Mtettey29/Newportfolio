# 🔒 SECURE DEPLOYMENT GUIDE

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY UPDATE COMPLETED

Your Gmail App Password has been secured and is no longer visible in public code.

---

## 🛡️ Security Measures Implemented:

### ✅ 1. Secure Configuration File
- **Created:** `email-config.php` (contains sensitive data)
- **Protected:** This file is NOT committed to Git
- **Purpose:** Stores Gmail App Password securely

### ✅ 2. Updated .gitignore
- **Added:** `email-config.php` to exclusion list
- **Protected:** All config files (*-config.php)
- **Secured:** Environment files (.env*)

### ✅ 3. Modified Email Handler
- **Updated:** `send-email-smtp.php` now loads config securely
- **Protected:** No hardcoded passwords in main code
- **Fallback:** Shows error if config missing

    ]
];
